# UltimateCICDPipeline
This is a Ultimate CICD Pipeline implementation using, Jenkins, ArgoCD and Kubernetes.
This end-to-end Jenkins pipeline will automate the entire CI/CD process for a Django application, from code checkout to production deployment.





Today, I built the ultimate end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire CI/CD process for a Django application.

The pipeline operates with the following flow: Developers push their code to the GitHub repository. GitHub webhooks then trigger the Jenkins build. If the build is successful, the Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub, and the manifest repository is updated. ArgoCD continuously monitors the manifest repository and deploys the Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster.

Components of the pipeline:

1. GitHub is used for source code management of the Django application, and it also holds the manifest repository for Kubernetes.

2. Jenkins serves as the CI tool and is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. GitHub webhooks are used to trigger the Jenkins pipeline upon each code push. Jenkins then builds the Django application, containerizes it, and pushes the final Docker image to Docker Hub. Additionally, it updates the manifest repository with the appropriate image tag. Docker containers are employed as build agents in Jenkins, enhancing resource optimization and reducing overall project cost.

3. Argo CD is a Kubernetes-native continuous deployment (CD) tool. It retrieves updated manifest code from the Git repository and deploys it directly to the Kubernetes cluster. Argo CD continuously monitors the running infrastructure (the actual state) and compares it to the declaratively-defined code (the desired state or target state) of the application manifest repository. This process helps identify and rectify configuration drift.

4. The Kubernetes cluster is configured using Minikube on a local machine. Argo CD deploys the containerized Django application on this cluster.
